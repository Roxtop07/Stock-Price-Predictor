Stock Market Analysis & Prediction using LSTM

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing historical stock market data and predicting future stock prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) well-suited for time series forecasting.

🔍 Problem Statement

Stock market price movements are sequential and influenced by multiple factors. Traditional models often fail to capture the temporal dependencies in stock prices. This project addresses the need for accurate stock price forecasting using LSTM to capture sequential patterns in historical data.

🧠 Model Used
	•	LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory): A deep learning architecture capable of learning long-term dependencies in time series data.

📊 Technologies & Tools
	•	Python
	•	NumPy, Pandas
	•	Matplotlib, Seaborn
	•	Scikit-learn
	•	TensorFlow / Keras
	•	Jupyter Notebook

📁 Files in This Repository
	•	Stock Market Analysis Prediction LSTM.ipynb – The main notebook containing:
	•	Data preprocessing & visualization
	•	Train-test splitting
	•	LSTM model architecture
	•	Model training and evaluation
	•	Future predictions & plotting

📈 Workflow
	1.	Data Loading & Preprocessing
	•	Load historical stock price data
	•	Normalize features using MinMaxScaler
	2.	Data Visualization
	•	Plot historical stock trends
	•	Correlation heatmaps
	3.	Model Building
	•	Design LSTM network with appropriate layers
	•	Compile with loss function & optimizer
	4.	Model Training & Evaluation
	•	Fit the model on training data
	•	Validate using test data
	•	Evaluate using RMSE or similar metrics
	5.	Future Predictions
	•	Predict stock prices for unseen data
	•	Visualize actual vs predicted results

📌 Results
	•	The LSTM model demonstrates the ability to learn temporal patterns from stock data.
	•	Produces smooth predictions that follow real stock price trends.

🚀 Future Enhancements
	•	Incorporate more financial indicators like RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands
	•	Use multi-feature LSTM models
	•	Integrate attention mechanisms for better performance
	•	Deploy as a Streamlit or Flask web app
