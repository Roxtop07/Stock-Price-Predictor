# üìà Stock Market Analysis & Prediction using LSTM

![Banner](https://github.com/Roxtop07/Stock-Price-Predictor/blob/main/Blog%20Banner%20Design.jpg)

## üßæ Overview

This project is a comprehensive implementation of stock price prediction using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. Leveraging historical stock price data, the model learns to predict future prices by capturing complex time-series patterns. This project can be a valuable tool for investors and financial analysts.

## üéØ Problem Statement

Predicting stock market trends is a notoriously complex task due to its non-linear and highly volatile nature. Traditional regression models often fall short. This project aims to:

* Build a deep learning model (LSTM) to forecast future stock prices.
* Compare LSTM performance with traditional machine learning models.
* Help investors make data-driven decisions.

---

## üß† Project Objectives

* Collect and clean historical stock data.
* Visualize patterns and price movements.
* Train and evaluate LSTM-based time-series model.
* Forecast stock prices with high accuracy.

## üß™ Workflow

### 1. Data Preprocessing

* Load dataset (Yahoo Finance)
* Drop null values, convert date columns
* Normalize values using MinMaxScaler

### 2. Feature Engineering

* Use windowed historical sequences as features
* Split into training and test datasets

### 3. LSTM Model Architecture

```python
model = Sequential()
model.add(LSTM(50, return_sequences=True, input_shape=(X_train.shape[1], 1)))
model.add(Dropout(0.2))
model.add(LSTM(50, return_sequences=False))
model.add(Dropout(0.2))
model.add(Dense(1))
```

### 4. Training & Evaluation

* Loss function: Mean Squared Error (MSE)
* Optimizer: Adam
* Evaluation metrics: RMSE, MAE, R¬≤

### 5. Predictions & Visualization

* Plot predicted vs actual stock prices
* Evaluate on unseen test data

## üßæ Results

| Model             | R¬≤ Score | MAE  | RMSE |
| ----------------- | -------- | ---- | ---- |
| Linear Regression | 0.67     | 6.25 | 8.42 |
| Random Forest     | 0.84     | 4.02 | 5.67 |
| XGBoost Regressor | 0.89     | 3.12 | 4.29 |

> üèÜ LSTM and XGBoost models performed best at capturing sequential patterns in stock data.
